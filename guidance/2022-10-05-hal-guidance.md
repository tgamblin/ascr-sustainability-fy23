I talked with Hal yesterday and got some information. Here are my notes from that
conversation. I didnâ€™t clear these notes with Hal, so I suppose that there could be
variations or changes to what is stated below, but I would imagine the basics would stay
the same:

* Open call: The official procedure for the labs to respond to the open call is for
  them to contact their PM and then Hal said he believes that the PM will send them
  a PAMS link, but it could be slightly different. In any case, get permission from
  the PM and they will help you move forward
  * Dates will be earlier than currently printed in the Open call
  * Expected FOA revision next week (week of Oct 9)
  * Dates not set in stone yet:
    * Pre-applications due around Nov 21
    * Applications due around December 19
  * They want to make sure everything is done in time to be up and running this year
* Aiming for March start of projects
* $125k is per project (not per institution)
  * Goal for FY23 is to get the governance structure set up, give leads a charge
       code to get organized
* What do they expect for FY23 proposed work?
  * Strongly recommend that team proposes to set up an external advisory board or
       panel
  * Propose to collect information needed to put together an operating budget for
       FY24
  * Expect that proposal will name collaborators up front and already have
       commitment from them (no need for budgets at this stage though)
  * Propose to get teams in place and ready, collaborators, collaborative contracts
       with industry, non-profits, academia, whatever can be done to ensure that
       team can hit the ground running in FY24
  * Define what is needed to make the project sustainable, meet the needs of
       community users that you hope to have
* Anticipate that FY24 proposal call will come out with a very short turnaround (in
     the summer?), so be ready for that
  * Good to have a proposed budget and a plan for what you will do if you are
       awarded a reduced budget
*    How will budgets flow ? E.g. through lead institution? Through ASCR?
  *    Will need to figure that out, but likely
    *    Shorter duration, intermittent funds can go through lead institution as subcontract
    *    Longer term funds can go through program office direct to collaborating institution
  *    They are happy to have a conversation about this
*    How many FY23 funded seedlings are expected to survive?
  * Unknown, maybe all will survive. However, it will depend on ASCR budget and
       proposed budgets
  * There may also end up being significant overlap in seedlings, in which case they
       would want to down select
*    What should software project teams expect during FY23?
  *    Seedling leads will be reaching out to them to find out their needs/requirements
