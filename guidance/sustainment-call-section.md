# 1. Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR)

## (d) Advanced Computing Technologies (ACT)

By actively partnering with the research community, including industry and Federal
agencies, on the development of technologies that enable next-generation machines, ASCR
ensures that commercially available architectures serve the needs of the scientific
community.

Research topics currently of interest for ACT include:

* The maintenance and improvement of the software ecosystem, including that developed
  through the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), which provides shared software packages,
  novel evaluation systems, and applications relevant to the science and engineering
  requirements of DOE, in order that the full potential of the current and future
  computing systems deployed by DOE can be continuously realized.

For software-ecosystem sustainment, ASCR expects to convene a merit-review panel in
January 2023 for applications submitted in this area. ASCR seeks to seed collaborations
focused on software sustainability, and while applications should articulate a long-term
vision for sustaining a substantial part of the ecosystem of software for scientific and
high-performance computing and should describe how their efforts might be rapidly scaled
up in the future, applicants should request no more than $125,000 for a one-year award.
From the set of applications reviewed by the January 2023 panel, ASCR anticipates
selecting three to five awards. Applications submitted prior to December 19, 2022, and
complying with the specified funding ceiling, will be reviewed by that panel. Applicants
are encouraged to submit pre-applications prior to November 21, 2022.
